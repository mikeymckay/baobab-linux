# Uncomment this to cause a core dump at the spot where a signal is

# provide a better stack trace in the core dump to aid in debugging

#    Option	"NoTrapSignals"

# Uncomment this to disable the <Crtl><Alt><BS> server abort sequence
# This allows clients to receive this key event.

#    Option	"DontZap"

# Uncomment this to disable switching with <Crtl><Alt><Function key>
# However, it enables <Alt><SysRq>,<Function key>

#    Option     "VTSysReq"

# Uncomment this to disable switching with <Crtl><Alt><Function key>
# It does *NOT* enable <Alt><SysRq>,<Function key>

#    Option	"VTDontSwitch"

# Uncomment this to disable the <Crtl><Alt><KP_+>/<KP_-> mode switching
# sequences.  This allows clients to receive these key events.

#    Option	"DontZoom"

# Uncomment this to disable tuning with the xvidtune client. With
# it the client can still run and fetch card and monitor attributes,
# but it will not be allowed to change them. If it tries it will
# receive a protocol error.

#    Option	"DisableVidModeExtension"

# Uncomment this to enable the use of a non-local xvidtune client.

#    Option	"AllowNonLocalXvidtune"

# Uncomment this to disable dynamically modifying the input device
# (mouse and keyboard) settings.

#    Option	"DisableModInDev"

# Uncomment this to enable the use of a non-local client to
# change the keyboard or mouse settings (currently only xset).

#    Option	"AllowNonLocalModInDev"

# Set the basic blanking screen saver timeout.

    Option	"blank time"	"10"	# 10 minutes

# Set the DPMS timeouts.  These are set here because they are global
# rather than screen-specific.  These settings alone don't enable DPMS.
# It is enabled per-screen (or per-monitor), and even then only when
# the driver supports it.

    Option	"off time"	"60"

# On some platform the server needs to estimate the sizes of PCI

# To customise the XKB settings to suit your keyboard, modify the

# keyboard, you will probably want to use one of:
#
#    Option	"XkbModel"	"pc102"
#    Option	"XkbModel"	"pc105"
#
# If you have a Microsoft Natural keyboard, you can use:
#
#    Option	"XkbModel"	"microsoft"
#
# If you have a US "windows" keyboard you will want:
#
#    Option	"XkbModel"	"pc104"
#
# Then to change the language, change the Layout setting.
# For example, a german layout can be obtained with:
#
#    Option	"XkbLayout"	"de"
#
# or:
#
#    Option	"XkbLayout"	"de"
#    Option	"XkbVariant"	"nodeadkeys"
