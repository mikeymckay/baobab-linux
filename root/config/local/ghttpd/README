1. unpack the archive:
      tar -xzf ghttpd.tgz
2. install the config file:
      mv ghttpd/ghttpd.conf /etc
3. move the rest to /usr/local: 
      mv ghttpd /usr/local
4. launch the server:
      /usr/local/ghttpd/ghttpd

You'll probably want to put some docs for it to serve in 
/usr/local/ghttpd/htdocs and cgi scripts in /usr/local/ghttpd/cgi-bin.
To get it to start at boot-up, add '/usr/local/ghttpd/ghttpd' to 
/usr/local/sbin/init, then freeze your configuration (run 'freezesh').
Note that you can't use port 80, since the config httpd uses that. The
default port is 81, so to connect to your new server, use:

   http://your.ip.address:81

You can change this in /etc/ghttpd.conf. You can also kill the config
httpd if you don't need it and use port 80.
