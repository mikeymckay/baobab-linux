# Sample script for printing to a networked postsript printer via

netcat 192.168.1.102 9100

#
# netcat is a simple program that streams raw data from stdin to the
# specified hostip and port. The example below works on my home LAN,
# where 192.168.1.102 is my linux box that acts as a print server.
# It runs a simple perl script that listens to port 9100, sending 
# any data that it gets to the printer via the appropriate gs filter.
