The heritage of this theme is complex.  It is derived, in the direct
sense, from the Sawmill theme of the same name.  That theme has a
complex history, which is given in its README file.  In the interest
of accuracy, it is quoted here verbatim:

    This theme is based on the QNX Photon microGUI (screenshots at
    http://www.qnx.com/amiga/delivering.html).  Many image components
    were taken from the minEguE enlightenment theme by Ben FrantzDale
    (frantzdb@admin.arhs.net). The rest is by Ryan Lovett
    (ryan@ocf.berkeley.edu) with modifications from John Harper.

Of course, the URL given there is no longer available, and there seems
to be a dearth of information on this (aparently aborted) project.  In
light of this, I took considerable liberties with the graphics I
inherited from the Sawmill theme, adding a number of elements in a
style which seemed to fit that of the window decorations.

Regarding the ownership of these graphics, it is not clear if they are
copyrighted (by Ben FrantzDale), or if they are available in the
public domain.  To the best of my knowledge, they may be freely
distributed and modified.  This permission extends to those graphics
which I added (the ledclock display, windows.xpm, linux.xpm, and
others).
