<center><h1>Welcome to M4I!</h1></center>
<p>M4I is a customized version of 
<a href="http://midori.transmeta.com" target="Resource Window">Midori Linux</a>
specifically designed for the Iopener and IA-1 platforms. The customization 
was begun by 
<a href="http://tengu.homeip.net/midori/" target="Resource Window">Ingo Paschke</a>
and has been taken up by 
<a href="http://m4i.homeip.net" target="Resource Window">Bob Dougherty</a>.
This version also includes binaries made available by wildwildwes and Sevenn.
(See the 
<a href="http://www.ia1hacking.com/">ia1hacking site</a> for more info.)

<p>This location (http://127.0.0.1) is your web browser based 
configuration system. You can configure most aspects of your
system through these pages. Note that you must do 'store configuration'
to save your current configuration in flash memory. This will also save
the current state of your applications, such as you web browser and xmms.</p>

<p>Some random notes:
<ul>
<li>You have access to a root console, which you might need for running
commands that require root permission. Hit ctrl-alt-F1 (F1 is the 'back' key
on the stock Iopener keyboard) to get to the root console. To get back to 
the X console (this screen), hit ctrl-alt-F2.</li>

<li>To see your system log messages, hit ctrl-alt-F4, or type 'dmesg | more' 
on any terminal window.</li>

<li>You can adjust most of the configurable options from this web interface.
However, you can also add stuff that you want run each time you boot up
(such as NFS mounts) to /usr/local/sbin/init. To permanently save 
your configuration, select the 'store configuration' 
option in the web config; or, equivalently, run the 'freezesh' command 
as root.</li>

<li>To use a USB storage device, just plug it in and mount it. If it's the 
first device that you plugged in, it will be available as /dev/sda. (See the 
system log after you plug it in to verify this.) You will, of course, need a 
mount point: 'mkdir /tmp/stuff'. Then you can mount: 'mount /dev/sda1 
/tmp/stuff'. (Note that Zip drives mount on partition 4: 
'mount /dev/sda4 /tmp/stuff'.) Once mounted, look in /tmp/stuff to see if it 
worked.</li>

<li>To make an electronic slide show, first get access to your
photos (USB zip drive, compact flash card reader, NFS mount, etc). Then,
go to the root console and run something like 
'fbi -ut 10 /path/to/your/photos/*' (run fbi without args to get help).
You can also try xli from an xterm, but fbi has some nicer slideshow options
(like on the fly zoom while the show's running).</li>
