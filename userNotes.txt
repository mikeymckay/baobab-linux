NFS mounts:

From 'jbarr', on:
  http://www.linux-hacker.net/cgi-bin/UltraBoard/UltraBoard.pl?Action=ShowPost&Board=whatever&Post=1945

Next, i tried to mount the NFS share on the iOpener, but I couldn't get it 
to work. Then I remembered that if you go into the web-based configuration, 
you can open a root terminal window. When I ran the mount command here, it 
worked just fine! I did a cd to the mount point and voila! there were the 
songs.

Finally, I openerd XMMS and added the directory to the play list. Works 
like a charm!!!

Next challenge: How to automate this step so that the next time I boot, I 
don't have to manually mount. I will try to edit fstab to see if that will 
work.

OK, I think I got it. I added the following lines to the "profile" file in 
the /tmp/config directory:

  mkdir /tmp/music
  mount -o wsize=1024,rsize=2048 192.168.1.100:/m /tmp/music

and then saved the storage space throught the web-based configuration 
screen. A reboot auto-mounted the share and now when I bring up XMMS and 
click on "+ dir", it auto-adds all the files! Very cool!

TIPS:

If you want to get to a root console just type control-alt-F1
  control-alt-F2 to go back to :0

  Want vnc on a separate console? 
  set your remote PC display resolution to 800x600 and run winvnc app mode on your PC
  now at the iopener type:
  control-alt-F1
  X :1 &
  export DISPLAY=:1
  vncviewer -fullscreen 192.168.1.100 (or whatever IP address your PC is)
  control-alt-F3 (to switch to vnc console)
  control-alt-F2 (to switch back to midori console)

Ingo,

  Can you add the xli (x load image) binary to the next M4I distribution?

  I tested the binary from here and it works on the iopener with M4I:
  ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/suse/i386/6.1/full-names/i386/xli-1.16-55.i386.rpm
  (but any xli version that works would also be fine).

  This allows you to display, stretch, and rotate .jpg or .gif images onto the
  X root console. So, a simple script using wget and xli can turn the
  iopener into a landscape or portrait slideshow picture frame.

  example:
  wget -O /tmp/image.gif http://midori.transmeta.com/manual/midori_logo_full.gif
  xli -onroot -fillscreen -rotate 90 /tmp/image.gif

Here is some fun stuff to play with using Midori on the iopener (unsupported examples)

  Hubble image slide show (or make your own slideshow, just change filelist)
  cd /tmp
  wget http://www.hunkler.com/mark/iopener/midori/hubble_slideshow.tar | tar xvf -
  ./hubble
  control-alt-f3 to switch to console :1
  control-alt-f2 to switch to console :0
  control-c in xterm to kill script

  Play xmame games
  cd /tmp
  wget http://www.hunkler.com/mark/iopener/midori/mame.tar.gz | gunzip -c | tar xvf -
  ./xmame -rompath . -scale 2 mspacman
  press "3" to insert a coin
  press "1" to start single player game
  (sound is only supported on a v1 iopener right now using M4I 0.093)
