NOTICE: I would very much appreciate it if you would contact me before you
	re-distribute modified code, and include credits to me in the
	modified code. You are requried to include credit to me in any 
	redistribution of this code by law (under the GPL) but you are not
	required to contact me, but I would just like you to so that I know
	about it, I won't deny you permission, since I cannot do that. 
	(and wouldn't anyway)

NEW IN VERSION 1.4:
- This version now supports inetd and virtual hosts, see the configuration
file (ghttpd.conf) for details on how to set these up.
- Lots of cgi fixes and other bug fixes. 
- Quite a few routines replaced with faster ones.
- ghttpd now changes to user nobody after initialization.

ghttpd is a fast and efficient HTTP server that has CGI support.(no post support, only get)
ghttpd has a small memory inprint and is capable of handling thousands of
simultanious connections. It is ideal for large and small websites. It is
very simple to configure with only a few options to change if changing is
needed at all. You can have ghttpd up and running within two minutes easily
because of its very simple configuration file and installation routine.
ghttpd will run on the majority of UNIX systems but has not been tested on
any other platform (by me that is) other than GNU/Linux (kernel=2.2.3).

Below is the Installation instructions and the usage instructions

Installation
------------
Firstly you will need to edit ghttpd.conf that contains the few options that
may need to be modified. After that just do this:

make
[su -] (if not already root)
make install

(ghttpd is installed into /usr/local/ghttpd)
To execute ghttpd just type 'ghttpd' at the shell prompt, if you wish the
computer to run ghttpd on start-up automatically then you just need to
insert 'ghttpd' into the startup file.

RedHat Startup file is: /etc/rc.d/rc.local
Just append a line to the file with simply 'ghttpd' on it.

Usage
-----
ghttpd will have been installed into /usr/local/ghttpd
All you need to do to run it is go to that directory and type ghttpd, then
just use a webbrowser to connect to your computer and then you should get
the default page come up, if this works then everything is ok !

Initially all the documents are stored in /usr/local/ghttpd/htdocs and all
the CGI files are stored in /usr/local/ghttpd/cgi-bin.
You can change these locations by editing /etc/ghttpd.conf if you wish.

The configuration file (/etc/ghttpd.conf) has many other options for you to
fiddle with aswell if you want to. If you want to setup ghttpd for virtual
hosts or to use inetd then please read /etc/ghttpd.conf

A log file is recorded everytime someone connects to the server, this 
log file is /usr/local/ghttpd/ghttpd.log
It is quite readable, unlike some others that I have seen.

QUICK 'GET-UP WEBSITE INSTRUCTIONS'
--
1. Make your website
2. Install ghttpd as documented above
3. Copy your website to /usr/local/ghttpd/htdocs

Thats it.
