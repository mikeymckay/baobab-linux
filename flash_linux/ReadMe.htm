Macromedia<br>
Flash Player 5<br>
Netscape Plug-in for Linux<br>
15 February 2001
<p><br>
  Macromedia is proud to release the Macromedia Flash Player 5 Netscape plug-in 
  for<br>
  the Linux operating system.</p>
<p><br>
  Supported Distributions<br>
  -----------------------</p>
<p>The Macromedia Flash Player plug-in requires an Intel x86-based Linux<br>
  distribution with ELF binary support. The distribution must<br>
  support the GNU C library (glibc 2.0 or greater). Distributions<br>
  that meet these requirements include:</p>
<p> - RedHat 5.x, 6.x, 7.0</p>
<p>The plugin should work for more recent distributions as well. </p>
<p>MkLinux for Power Macintosh is not currently supported.</p>
<p><br>
  Supported Browsers<br>
  ------------------</p>
<p>Netscape Navigator 4.0 or greater is required. The glibc version of<br>
  Netscape Navigator must be used.</p>
<p><br>
  Installation<br>
  ------------</p>
<p>The following section assumes that you have unpacked the archive<br>
  flash_linux.tar.gz into the top level of your user directory. Your<br>
  user directory is referred to as $HOME.</p>
<p>The Macromedia Flash Player can be installed in two ways:<br>
  - Install the Flash Player system-wide, making it available<br>
  to all users of the computer.<br>
  or<br>
  - Install the Macromedia Flash Player in a user account, making it<br>
  available only to that user.</p>
<p><br>
  Installing the Macromedia Flash Player System-Wide:</p>
<p>You will need root access to the computer to install the Macromedia Flash Player<br>
  system-wide.</p>
<p>1. Copy the Macromedia Flash Player (libflashplayer.so) into the Netscape <br>
  plug-in directory.</p>
<p>cp $HOME/flash_linux/libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/netscape/plugins</p>
<p>2. Copy the Macromedia Flash Player Java class file (ShockwaveFlash.class)<br>
  into the Netscape plug-in directory.</p>
<p>cp $HOME/flash_linux/ShockwaveFlash.class /usr/lib/netscape/plugins</p>
<p>3. Start Netscape.</p>
<p>netscape &amp;</p>
<p>4. Verify the installation by typing about:plugins in the location bar.<br>
  You should see the Flash Player listed as &quot;Shockwave Flash 5.0r47&quot;</p>
<p>5. To test the Macromedia Flash Player go to:</p>
<p>http://www.flash.com/</p>
<p>(NOTE: If the Web site www.flash.com does not automatically detect that<br>
  you have the Flash Player installed, click on the link<br>
  &quot;If you know you have Flash, click here&quot;)</p>
<p><br>
  Installing the Macromedia Flash Player in a User Account:</p>
<p>1. If you have not already used Netscape from the user account,<br>
  launch Netscape and close it. This will create a Netscape<br>
  preferences directory (.netscape) in your home directory.<br>
  The preferences directory will be named:</p>
<p>$HOME/.netscape</p>
<p>2. Create a plugins directory in the Netscape preferences<br>
  directory.</p>
<p>mkdir $HOME/.netscape/plugins</p>
<p> If the mkdir command reports the error &quot;cannot make directory:<br>
  File exists&quot;, do not be alarmed. This means only that the<br>
  directory was already present and did not need to be created.</p>
<p>3. Copy the Macromedia Flash Player (libflashplayer.so) into the Netscape <br>
  plug-in directory.</p>
<p>cp $HOME/flash_linux/libflashplayer.so $HOME/.netscape/plugins</p>
<p>4. Copy the Macromedia Flash Player Java class file (ShockwaveFlash.class)<br>
  into the Netscape plug-in directory.</p>
<p>cp $HOME/flash_linux/ShockwaveFlash.class $HOME/.netscape/plugins</p>
<p>5. Start Netscape.</p>
<p>netscape &amp;</p>
<p>6. Verify the installation by typing about:plugins in the location bar.<br>
  You should see the Macromedia Flash Player listed as &quot;Shockwave Flash 5.0r47&quot;</p>
<p>7. To test the Macromedia Flash Player go to:</p>
<p>http://www.flash.com/</p>
<p>(NOTE: If the Web site www.flash.com does not automatically detect that<br>
  you have the Flash Player installed, click on the link<br>
  &quot;If you know you have Flash, click here&quot;)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Troubleshooting<br>
  ---------------</p>
<p>Q: When I try to visit a Web site that contains Flash content, I get the<br>
  error message &quot;Unknown type application/octet-stream&quot;.</p>
<p>A: The Web site you are attempting to view needs to properly configure<br>
  their Web server with the MIME types for Flash content. Specifically,<br>
  they must add the MIME types:<br>
  .spl application/futuresplash<br>
  .swf application/x-shockwave-flash<br>
  You might want to let the Webmaster of the site know of the problem.</p>
<p><br>
  Q: My Linux system is RedHat 6.0. When I browse to a Web page containing<br>
  Flash content, the browser reports &quot;Starting Java&quot; and then crashes.</p>
<p>A: This is a Java-related bug in the RedHat 6.0 distribution. Red Hat<br>
  has documented the problem and provides a fix on their Product Support<br>
  FAQ Web page:</p>
<p> http://www.redhat.com/support?faq</p>
<p><br>
  Optimal X Server Configuration<br>
  ------------------------------</p>
<p>Flash Player should work with any X server configuration. However,<br>
  optimal performance is achieved at the following color depths and<br>
  color mask settings:</p>
<p> Depth: 8<br>
  Visual: PseudoColor</p>
<p> Depth: 15<br>
  Bits Per Pixel: 16<br>
  Visual: TrueColor<br>
  Red Mask: 0x00007C00<br>
  Green Mask: 0x000003E0<br>
  Blue Mask: 0x0000001F</p>
<p> Depth: 16<br>
  Bits Per Pixel: 16<br>
  Visual: TrueColor<br>
  Red Mask: 0x0000F800<br>
  Green Mask: 0x000007E0<br>
  Blue Mask: 0x0000001F</p>
<p> Depth: 24<br>
  Bits Per Pixel: 24<br>
  Visual: TrueColor<br>
  Red Mask: 0x00FF0000<br>
  Green Mask: 0x0000FF00<br>
  Blue Mask: 0x000000FF</p>
<p> Depth: 32<br>
  Bits Per Pixel: 32<br>
  Visual: TrueColor<br>
  Red Mask: 0x00FF0000<br>
  Green Mask: 0x0000FF00<br>
  Blue Mask: 0x000000FF</p>
<p> Depth: 32<br>
  Bits Per Pixel: 32<br>
  Visual: TrueColor<br>
  Red Mask: 0x000000FF<br>
  Green Mask: 0x0000FF00<br>
  Blue Mask: 0x00FF0000</p>
<p>In addition, the X server's image byte order must match the host byte<br>
  order in order to achieve optimal performance using one of the above<br>
  configurations.</p>
<p>Macromedia Flash Player takes advantage of the the MIT-SHM Shared Memory<br>
  Extension. This will boost performance on supported systems.</p>
<p><br>
  Known Bugs<br>
  ----------</p>
<p>Some web sites use JavaScript detection and may default to a <br>
  non-Flash page for users who are not on Macintosh or Windows <br>
  platforms. Some web sites may have a link you can click to get <br>
  to the Flash content. </p>
<p>RealFlash is not supported by RealAudio on the UNIX platform.</p>
<p>A defect was discovered in the sound functionality of the 5.0r45 <br>
  build of the Flash Player Netscape plug-in for Linux. Occasionally <br>
  and randomly, sounds in a Flash movie would fail to play. This <br>
  problem affected only configurations where Flash Player played <br>
  sounds directly through OSS (Open Sound System). <br>
  Configurations using Enlightened Sound Daemon (ESD) were not <br>
  affected. This new version of the Flash Player fixes the above <br>
  defect. Sounds now play properly through both OSS and ESD.<br>
  In the old Flash Player version, one workaround to the problem <br>
  is to run ESD on your Linux system. ESD is installed by default in <br>
  several popular Linux distributions, including RedHat.<br>
