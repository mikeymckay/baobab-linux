To compile a recent 2.4.xx kernel, you will need the following patches:

  addpart
  cmdline

The preempt-kernel patch will give you the option of compiling a pre-emtible
kernel. This might make the GUI a little more responsive on a system
with limited resources. I haven't done careful tests, but it does seem
to make things a bit snappier.

You probably also want to change the default video mode of the kernel 
(SVGA_MODE). That's set in the top-level kernel Makefile. I've changed the 
'export SVGA_MODE ...' line to this:

   # RFD 2002.12.02 changed video mode to 788 (16bpp, 600x800)
   export SVGA_MODE = -DSVGA_MODE=788
